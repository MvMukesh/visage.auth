Data Flow:

1. User sends a GET request to the root path (/)
2. The read_root function intercepts the request
3. Function returns a RedirectResponse object, instructing the user's browser to redirect to the /auth path
4. ser's browser performs the redirection and sends a request to the /auth path (assuming the authentication logic resides there)
